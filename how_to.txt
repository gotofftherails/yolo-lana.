==Acquiring the  data==

Get the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data.  This can be dowloaded from a number of places.

To get all of Australia, use this script, this is around 7GB of data.

https://github.com/gotofftherails/yolo-lana./blob/master/get_data.py

You will now have a multitude of files, which can now be unzipped all in one hit.

$ unzip "*.zip"

Convert the DEM data into a format SPLAT! can use (SDF).

$ srtm2sdf *.xxx

This data can now be used within SPLAT.

You will then need further information to drive SPLAT!.  From data.gov.au you can get the follwoing spreadsheet (http://data.gov.au/dataset/licensed-broadcasting-transmitter-data/) which offers a stack of useful information, importantly:
* Transmit powers
* Antenna height
* Transmit frequency
* Call sign
* Location (x,y coordinate)

And other goodies.

To use Splat at a minimum two files need to be created a .qth and a .lrp.  Both files are created from the spreadsheet.


Saved as a csv the file can be parsed with the following script:

https://github.com/gotofftherails/yolo-lana./blob/master/create_input_files.py

The script can be used in two ways - either to generate all .qth and .lrp files in one hit, or to call the create_coverage_files.py as a module and pass them through one by one.

==Creating Coverage Files==

The process of creating usable coverage files requires the following:

* Create a PPM and KML to reference it
* Reszie the PPM file
* Create an opacity for the file
* Turn all white into a transparency
* Convert the PPM to a PNG
* Rewrite the KML using sed to reference the new PNG file.

At this stage files exist that can be viewed in Google Maps or Google Earth.

The following script can be used to automate this, you can call this as a module if required.

https://github.com/gotofftherails/yolo-lana./blob/master/create_coverage_files.py

The next step is to convert to a format usable in GIS systems.  The images are simply images and do not convey geographic information yet.

The process is to:

* Convert the file KML and png to a world file.  
* Convert the world file to a geotiff


The following shell script can be used to batch the KML.
https://github.com/gotofftherails/yolo-lana./blob/master/kml2wld.sh

First you need to zip all KMl into a .kmz.  To do this:

$ zip filename.kmz filename.kml

The world file has three parts, a png, xml and xxx

You can then convert the world file to geotiff with the following:


$ gdalwarp input.png output.tif
